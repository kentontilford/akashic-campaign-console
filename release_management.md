## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Environments

#### Environment Progression

```
Developer → CI/CD → Development → Testing → Staging → Production
```

**Environment Specifications**:
```yaml
environments:
  development:
    purpose: "Feature development and initial testing"
    data: "Synthetic test data"
    integrations: "Mock services"
    deployment: "Automatic on merge to develop"
  
  testing:
    purpose: "QA testing and automation"
    data: "Anonymized production subset"
    integrations: "Sandbox services"
    deployment: "Automatic on passing tests"
  
  staging:
    purpose: "Production-like testing and UAT"
    data: "Production-like dataset"
    integrations: "Production services (test mode)"
    deployment: "Manual approval required"
  
  production:
    purpose: "Live customer environment"
    data: "Live customer data"
    integrations: "Production services"
    deployment: "Manual approval + change control"
```

### Deployment Patterns

#### Blue-Green Deployment

```yaml
blue_green_deployment:
  strategy: "Zero-downtime deployment with instant rollback"
  
  process:
    1. "Deploy new version to inactive environment (Green)"
    2. "Run health checks and smoke tests"
    3. "Switch traffic from Blue to Green"
    4. "Monitor for issues"
    5. "Keep Blue environment as rollback option"
  
  benefits:
    - "Zero downtime"
    - "Instant rollback capability"
    - "Production testing before traffic switch"
  
  considerations:
    - "Requires double infrastructure"
    - "Database migration complexity"
    - "Stateful application challenges"
```

#### Rolling Deployment

```yaml
rolling_deployment:
  strategy: "Gradual replacement of instances"
  
  process:
    1. "Deploy to 25% of instances"
    2. "Monitor metrics for 10 minutes"
    3. "Deploy to 50% of instances"
    4. "Monitor metrics for 10 minutes"
    5. "Deploy to 100% of instances"
  
  benefits:
    - "Lower resource requirements"
    - "Gradual risk exposure"
    - "Early issue detection"
  
  rollback_triggers:
    - "Error rate > 1%"
    - "Response time > 2x baseline"
    - "Health check failures > 10%"
```

#### Canary Deployment

```yaml
canary_deployment:
  strategy: "Limited exposure to new version"
  
  traffic_routing:
    canary: 5%
    stable: 95%
  
  success_criteria:
    - "Error rate < 0.1%"
    - "Response time within 10% of baseline"
    - "User satisfaction metrics stable"
  
  monitoring_period: "24 hours"
  
  progression:
    - "5% for 24 hours"
    - "25% for 12 hours"
    - "50% for 6 hours"
    - "100% if all metrics pass"
```

### Database Migration Strategy

#### Migration Best Practices

```sql
-- Example migration with rollback plan
-- Migration: Add user preferences table
-- Rollback: Drop user preferences table

BEGIN;

-- Forward migration
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    preferences JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_preferences_user_id ON user_preferences(user_id);

-- Add trigger for updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER user_preferences_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON user_preferences
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Rollback plan (commented for documentation)
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_preferences;

COMMIT;
```

#### Zero-Downtime Migrations

```yaml
migration_strategy:
  phase_1_additive_changes:
    - "Add new columns with default values"
    - "Add new tables"
    - "Add new indexes concurrently"
    
  phase_2_data_migration:
    - "Migrate data in batches"
    - "Update application to use new schema"
    - "Maintain backward compatibility"
    
  phase_3_cleanup:
    - "Remove old columns after full deployment"
    - "Drop unused indexes"
    - "Clean up deprecated code"
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Decision Matrix

#### Rollback Triggers

**Automatic Rollback**:
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5x baseline
- Health check failures > 50%
- Database connection failures
- Critical security vulnerabilities

**Manual Rollback Consideration**:
- Error rate 1-5%
- Response time 2-5x baseline
- User complaints > 10% increase
- Performance degradation
- Feature functionality issues

### Rollback Procedures

#### Application Rollback

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Application rollback script

ENVIRONMENT=${1:-staging}
PREVIOUS_VERSION=${2}

echo "🔄 Starting rollback for ${ENVIRONMENT}"

if [[ -z "${PREVIOUS_VERSION}" ]]; then
    # Get previous version from deployment history
    PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(kubectl rollout history deployment/akashic-intelligence \
        -n akashic-${ENVIRONMENT} | tail -2 | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
fi

echo "📦 Rolling back to version: ${PREVIOUS_VERSION}"

# Perform rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/akashic-intelligence \
    --to-revision=${PREVIOUS_VERSION} \
    -n akashic-${ENVIRONMENT}

# Wait for rollback to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/akashic-intelligence \
    -n akashic-${ENVIRONMENT} \
    --timeout=300s

# Verify rollback success
echo "🔍 Verifying rollback..."
curl -f https://${ENVIRONMENT}.akashicintelligence.com/api/health

echo "✅ Rollback completed successfully"
```

#### Database Rollback

```yaml
database_rollback:
  scenario_1_schema_changes:
    method: "Restore from backup"
    steps:
      - "Stop application traffic"
      - "Restore database from pre-migration backup"
      - "Deploy previous application version"
      - "Verify data integrity"
    
  scenario_2_data_changes:
    method: "Reverse data migration"
    steps:
      - "Run reverse migration scripts"
      - "Verify data consistency"
      - "Update application if needed"
    
  scenario_3_critical_corruption:
    method: "Point-in-time recovery"
    steps:
      - "Identify last known good state"
      - "Restore from continuous backup"
      - "Replay transaction logs"
      - "Validate data integrity"
```

### Rollback Communication

#### Stakeholder Notification

```yaml
rollback_communication:
  immediate_notification:
    recipients: ["engineering_team", "product_team", "customer_success"]
    method: "Slack alert + email"
    template: |
      🚨 ROLLBACK IN PROGRESS
      
      Environment: {{ environment }}
      Reason: {{ rollback_reason }}
      ETA: {{ estimated_completion }}
      
      Status updates will be provided every 15 minutes.
  
  customer_notification:
    triggers:
      - "Production rollback"
      - "Extended downtime (>30 minutes)"
    method: "Status page + email"
    template: |
      We are experiencing technical issues and are working to resolve them.
      Some features may be temporarily unavailable.
      
      Expected resolution: {{ eta }}
